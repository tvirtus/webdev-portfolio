        Content value[edit]
        Content itself is what the end-user derives value from. Thus, "content" can refer to the information
        provided
        through the medium, the way in which the information was presented, as well as the added features included
        in
        the medium in which that information was delivered. The medium, however, provides little to no value to the
        end-user without the information and experiences that make up the content. Communication theory philosopher
        Marshall McLuhan famously coined the phrase, "The medium is the message."[3] In the case of content, the
        channel
        through which information is delivered, the "medium", affects how the end user perceives content, the
        "message".

        The author, producer, or publisher of an original source of information or experiences may or may not be
        directly responsible for the entire value that they attain as content in a specific context. For example,
        part
        of an original article (such as a headline from a news story) may be rendered on another web page displaying
        the
        results of a user's search engine query grouped with headlines from other news publications and related
        advertisements. The value that the original headline has in this group of query results from the search
        engine
        as a medium may be very different from the value that it had as message content in its original article.

        Content also leads to influencing other people in creating their own content, sometimes in a way that the
        original author did not or could not plan or imagine. This feature, adding the option of user innovation in
        a
        medium, means that users can develop their own content from existing content.

        Technological effects on content[edit]
        Traditionally, content was edited and tailored for the public through news editors, authors, and other kinds
        of
        content creators. However, not all information content requires creative authoring or editing. Through
        recent
        technological developments, truth is found in philosopher Marshall McLuhan's idea of a global village; new
        technologies allow for instantaneous movement of information from every corner to every point at the same
        time[4] has caused the globe to be contracted into a village by electric technology,[5] such as mobile
        phones
        and automated sensors. These new technologies can record events anywhere for publishing and converting in
        order
        to potentially reach a global audience on channels such as YouTube. Such recorded or transmitted information
        and
        visuals can be referred to as content. Content is no longer a product of only reputable sources; new
        technology
        has made primary sources of content more readily available to all. For example, a video of a politician
        giving a
        speech compared to an article written by a reporter who witnessed the speech.

        Media production and delivery technology may potentially enhance the value of content by formatting,
        filtering,
        and combining original sources of content for new audiences with new contexts. The greatest value for a
        given
        source of content for a specific audience is often found through such electronic reworking of content as
        dynamic
        and real-time as the trends that fuel its interest. Less emphasis on value from content stored for possible
        use
        in its original form, and more emphasis on rapid re-purposing, reuse, and redeployment has led many
        publishers
        and media producers to view their primary function less as originators and more as transformers of content.
        Thus, one finds out that institutions, that used to focus on publishing printed materials, are now
        publishing
        both databases and software to combine content from various sources for a wider variety of audiences.
